Getting-and-Cleaning-data-project
=================================

Below is a description of how I cleaned my data  •	I set my workspace by uploading the text files onto my computer. •	Facets were then selected from the 561 facet spaces.This was done by performing string operations to select those facets that contain ‘mean’ or standard deviation”. 79 facets were then removed and saved from the 561.The original facets were then renamed by removing the brackets and changing – to . . •	I parsed the training and testing data.i read all facet variables but only subset the variables in  ‘facet to remove’ and changed the variable names.The subject list, activity list and facet list should be the same length.i then changed the non facet variables to subject, activity and data type. This is the first tidy set. •	I then take function aggregate to group the variables in one line.ie the average per subject per activity.This is tidy set 2. •	I then selected all the content of the script run_analysis.R and after I clicked run.I got 2 files.
